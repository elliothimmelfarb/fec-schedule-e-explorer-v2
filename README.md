## FEC Schedule E Filings Explorer

#### Search for FEC schedule E filings by candidate or committee

##### Uses the [OpenFEC.gov API](https://api.open.fec.gov/developers/)

##### Built with:
- React
- Redux
- Express
- Bootstrap

### The backend is in a [separate express server hosted on Heroku](https://github.com/elliothimmelfarb/section-e-explorer-backend)

### Story:
This is the product of spending 3 days learning React for the first time, then spending 1 day learning Redux. I finished this app 4 days later.

##### Known issues:
- Some responses from openFEC come back empty. I will add console logging of the routes used for debugging.
- I need to make a better way to display when the responses come back empty
